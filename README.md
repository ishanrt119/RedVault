# üîê RedVault

**RedVault** is a secure, AI-augmented digital vault built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It allows users to **store, manage, and share sensitive data**‚Äîsuch as passwords, documents, or credentials‚Äîthrough a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted environment.

Designed for both individuals and teams, RedVault ensures privacy, security, and trust without relying on centralized servers. Leveraging the power of **canisters** and **smart contracts** on the Internet Computer, RedVault brings next-generation security infrastructure to your fingertips.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands

### üîÉ Initialize and Run Locally

```bash
cd RedVault/
dfx start --background
dfx deploy
````

Once deployed, visit your app at:

```
http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}
```

### üîÑ Generate Candid (for backend changes)

```bash
npm run generate
```

### üîß Start Frontend Dev Server

```bash
npm start
```

Will run at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

## üåê Deploying to the IC Mainnet

To deploy on the Internet Computer:

```bash
dfx deploy --network ic
```

> Note: You must have cycles and an identity configured for mainnet deployment.

---

## üìÑ Frontend Environment Notes

If you're not using DFX to host the frontend, ensure the correct `DFX_NETWORK` environment is set:

* Set `DFX_NETWORK=ic` in your environment
* Or configure it via `dfx.json` using `env_override`
